INTRODUCTION:

	In today's world of exponential growth, we see new changes happening everyday
which are affecting the world to some degree in some way or the other. This goes
on to affect even economies all over the world.Curious to understand the economic
growth rate in the real world, we considering a hypothetical scenario where the world
has a constant economic rate, and using data from 2010 and 2015, and try to
predict economic conditions of countries on 2020 if the same rate continues.
This would help us appreciate the changes we see day to day around us.

	From the economic growth that we have obtained, we see if it affects the way we live our lives.
The measurable quantity that we use for this purpose is population growth rate. We find the correlation
between population growth rate and economic growth rate and try to find the trend in this correlation.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:

• WinPython (3 or higher)
• Bokeh library (for Python)
• Matplotlib, Numpy, and Pandas packages (for Python)
• Windows (XP, 7 or higher), MacOS or Linux
• Processors: Intel Atom® processor, Intel® Core™ i3 processor or higher
• Disk space: 1GB or more

INSTRUCTION FOR OPERATION:

Make sure that all the .csv files are in tbe folder as Front-end.py and sourcecode.py.

If there is a pre-existing version of Python or any other python compiler, open Front-end.py in IDLE(Python GUI) only. Else, install above mentioned packages
through command prompt.

After opening Front-end.py, press F5 key to run the script.

Tkinter pop-up will instruct you to select a country.

Wait for a little more than 10 seconds for the console to take input for the 'year' variable.

After pressing Enter key after entering value, an output window will immediately pop up in the background with a list of options.

You have the luxury to select any of the options. However, displaying the graphs option is recomended to be clicked once, for error-free functioning of the program.
